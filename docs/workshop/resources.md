## Examples
One of the best ways to get started with designing your own graphic is to look at some examples and get inspired. It can be helpful to keep a folder full of graphics that you like, which you can always visit when you're feeling stuck (try to make sure you maintain a link to the original artist!). The ever-misattributed quote "good artists borrow; great artists steal" is applicable here - you can steal compositions, color schemes, and concepts from existing work that is successful. Of course, what you can't steal is specific elements from other people's work, and you should try to develop your own style rather than copying someone else's - this will give your work its own voice.

## Learn More
Learning to communicate visually should be (at least in my opinion) a full course that is taught to every graduate student. We only scratched the surface in this workshop - below are a collection of links and resources that will help you learn more, and hopefully help you get started quickly when approaching your next science graphic!

### General
- Much of the material, especially images, from this workshop come from Jen Christensen's book: [**Building Science Graphics**](https://www.buildingsciencegraphics.com). Although it is expensive, I would highly recommend supporting her by buying the book, especially if you liked the content of the workshop. The book is full of examples and lots of outside references. The digital e-book version is quite nice, and it is easier to zoom in and see details. 
	- Jen also keeps a public list of other resources, organized by topic, [here](https://www.buildingsciencegraphics.com/more-to-explore)
- [The OpenNotebook: Designing Science Graphics Tip Sheet](https://www.theopennotebook.com/2023/02/07/tip-sheet-designing-science-graphics/): the content of this blog post is similar to what you can find in [Building Science Graphics by Jen Christiansen](). It has a nice visual example of a graphic being developed from start to finish.
- [Rethinking the Ph.D. dissertation in botany: Widening the circle - Soltis et al. (2023)](https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajb2.16136): Although this seems to be on a very specific topic, it provides a lot of general information about public outreach, and how the public's relationship with science has changed over time. A main theme of the article is the importance of communicating effectively to the public and strategies for doing so (journal article).
- [Video abstracts and plain language summaries are more effective than graphical abstracts and published abstracts - Bredbenner & Simon (2019)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0224697): this study found that participants reported higher perceived understanding when presented with a video or plain language summary (p<0.0025), and that all groups enjoyed video abstracts the most followed by plain language summaries, and then graphical abstracts and published abstracts.
	- Some [examples of video abstracts](https://www.animateyour.science/post/8-ways-to-make-a-video-abstract) and different ways to make them.
- [Visual Abstracts to Disseminate Research on Social Media - Ibrahim et al. (2017)](https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/FullText/2017/12000/Visual_Abstracts_to_Disseminate_Research_on_Social.36.aspx): this study found that visual abstracts increased impressions on Twitter compared to non-visual abstract tweets. Article visits also increased 2.7-fold, reach increases 7.7-fold, and retweets increased 8.4-fold (journal article). 

### Composition
- [Beginner's Guide to Composition - Work over Easy](https://www.workovereasy.com/2019/06/13/a-beginners-guide-to-composition/): A simple, illustrated introduction to composition (blog post).
- [15 Composition Archetypes from Edgar Payne](https://www.muddycolors.com/2021/04/15-types-of-composition/): these compositions were defined for landscape paintings, but the same principles apply to all compositions (blog post).
- [How to Design a Poster](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2018/05/11/how-to-design-an-award-winning-conference-poster/): a well-written, detailed blog post about how to design a poster
- [Poster Gallery](https://sites.google.com/view/postergallery): A gallery of interesting poster designs, mostly from evolution-related conferences. Good to peruse for inspiration. 

### Typography
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com): a place to find and download new fonts. This site also has many articles to help you learn more about typography. *For your own sanity, try to stick with fonts that are available under an 'Open Font License' - this means you can freely use the font for any project*.
- [Google Font Pairings](https://heyreliable.com/ultimate-google-font-pairings/): Examples of google font pairings, curated by a designer 

### Color
- [Color & Light - James Gurney](https://www.amazon.com/Color-Light-Realist-Painter-Gurney/dp/0740797719): the BEST book on color theory
- [Color Coding - Bang Wong (2010)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth0810-573): A short note on color interactions, and an interesting method for color picking that produces good black and white reproduction
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co): Color theme website. There are many color theme websites out there. This one is my favorite. It is available on the web browser, as an app, and even as an extension for Adobe software. 
- [Adobe Color Picker](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel): helps you design color schemes based on classic harmonies (e.g. complimentary, triadic, etc). If you have an adobe account, you can save them and they will be ported to your Adobe Software

### Resources
- [Free Organism Silhouettes](https://www.phylopic.org): Silhouettes, available under Creative Commons license. Often useful for phylogenies and diagrams. 
- [Innovative Genomics Institute Icons](https://innovativegenomics.org/glossary/): CRISPR-related icons are free to use for non-commercial uses
- [Saxifraga](http://www.freenatureimages.eu): Free nature images (mostly from Europe)
- [Crastina - Where to Find Science Images](https://crastina.se/guides/the-poster-design-hub/scientific-images/): a nice complication of sources for science-related images
- [Seeing Is...](): an online resource that I developed with the hopes of 
- [Animate Your Science](https://www.animateyour.science): a company that focuses on science-specific training. They offer paid courses for learning Adobe Illustrator and Poster Design. 
- [Domestika](https://www.domestika.org/en): a creative community that produces high-quality courses on art and design (but not geared at science, specifically - so these courses will be more broad). You can find courses that help you learn basic skills, like [Adobe Illustrator for Beginners](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/1334-adobe-illustrator-for-beginners) and [Data Visualization](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/3605-data-visualization-design-infographics-in-illustrator). Courses are often on sale for $10 (so don't pay full price!)

### Data Visualization
