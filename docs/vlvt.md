# Visual Literacy & Visual Thinking

The term "visual literacy" has been around for about 50 years (Avgerinou & Ericson, 1997), but has not always had a strict definition.  

For the purposes of this resource, visual literacy is defined as: *the ability to find, interpret, evaluate, create, and use visual media effectively.*

## Visual Learners
65% of learners are visual learners, while 30% are verbal and 5% experiential (Gangwer, 2009; Bradford, 2011). However, traditional teaching methods such as the socratic method, seminars, readings, and lectures mostly satisfy the pedagogical needs of verbal learners, and thus fail to engage the majority of their students. 

## A Changing World
Schools and academia have traditionally emphasized textual forms of learning, but for many students the majority of the information they recieve outside of the classroom is visual and largely non-textual. 

The world has become increasingly image-rich. Especially as technologies, such as smart phones & tablets, have made creating and sharing images and videos easier (and more addictive) than ever before, and emerging technologies such as augmented reality & virtual spaces (e.g. the metaverse) begin to meld online worlds with our own. Our students msut learn to navigate a world in which they are inundated with images and visual forms of communication. 

Providing opportunities for students to learn using non-textual visual forms doesn't just "meet them where they are", but also improves the inclusivity of the classroom by catering to visual learners. By employing visuals in the classroom, you will also teach your students to think about visual forms of communication critically, just as we emphasize critical reading skills as essential for learning effective communication. These skills will serve them well in the future, regardless of what field they pursue. 

## Potential Benefits to Students
Ausburn and Ausburn (1978) list some potential benefits of developing visual literacy for students:

1. increase in all kinds of verbal skills,
2. improved self-expression and ordering of ideas,
3. increase in student motivation and interest in subjects of all types and at all levels,
4. ‘reaching’ students not being reached in traditional ways. Students such as the educationally disadvantaged, the truant, the socially underprivileged, the emotionally disturbed, the intellectually handicapped, the ethnic and bilinguals, the dyslexic, the deaf, those with speech pathology problems — all respond and have been helped in terms of both interest and achievement,
5. improved image of self and relationship to the world,
6. improved self-reliance, independence, and confidence.

In a 1997 review, Averingou & Ericson urge that these potential benefits are just as relevant in th 90's. This is just as true now, in 2022, as it has ever been.
