One of the most accessible ways to create vector figures is to simply use the different `shape tools`. This is similar to using the shape tools in Powerpoint of Keynote to create graphics, but Illustrator has extra features that extend the capabilities beyond what you can achieve in a presentation application. 

## Shapes

### Simple Shapes
When Illustrator opens, the shape will default to the rectangle tool.

Click and drag on the canvas to create a rectangle.

If you hold the **Shift** key while dragging, the shape will default to a perfect square

!!! tip "Step 1"

	Go ahead and create a large square or rectangle on your canvas. Make it fairly large.

Click and hold the square icon to see the other shape options you have. Click the Ellipse tool. 

Similar to the rectangle tool, if you hold Shift while clicking and dragging you will create a perfect circle.

!!! tip "Step 2"

	Make an oval and a perfect circle

To select one shape or the other you will need to use the selection tool (black arrow icon, or type **v**). Click on a shape to select it. 

When you select a shape, you might notice little square show up on the outline. These are called anchor points - you can use them to re-size your shape.

To rotate your objects, you will need to switch back to the selection tool (v). Hover near a corner and you will see your cursor turn into an arrow. Click and drag to rotate the object.

!! tip "Step 3"

	Try rotating and re-sizing your shapes


If you're feeling a little crowded on your canvas, you can clear it with the selection tool. Click and drag to select objects and hit the **delete** button on your keyboard to get rid of them. 

Alternatively, if you want to save them for later, you can drag them off the canvas into the grey space. 


### Polygon & Star Tools
Let's take a look at some of the more advanced tools. Switch the the polygon tool (hexagon icon). As you click and drag, try hitting the **up** and **down** arrows on your keyboard to make the number of vertices change. You can use this tool to make a triangle, or an octagon! Illustrator will remember the last setting you used, so if you make a triangle, it will keep making triangles until you make a different shape. 

You may notice that holding down shift no longer has the same effect - instead it forces one of the sides of you new shape to be perfectly horizontal. 

!!! tip "Step 4"

	Make a triangle and a heptagon. Force the baseline to be horizontal by using the **Shift** key while drawing one of your shapes. 

### Rounded Shapes
The last shape tool we will cover is the rounded rectangle tool.
