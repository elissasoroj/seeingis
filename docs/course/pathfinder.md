## Pathfinder
Finally, let's see some of the advanced features in Illustrator that you can't easily achieve in a presentation application. 

To set up the next demonstration, let's clear the canvas and make some new shapes. 

!!! tip "Step 9"

	a. Clear the canvas

	b. Make two shapes of any kind and give them both a fill color
	
	c. Place the shapes so that they are overlapping in some way

To select multiple objects, click and drag with the arrow tool to select multiple objects, or hold **Shift** as you click on each shape

Once they are selected, open the **Pathfinder** menu (symbol)

!!! tip "Step 11"

	a. Merge the shapes together using the 'Unite' option

This is an easy way to make compound shapes out of simple shapes. Now, the fill and outline are shared, so the compound shape takes on the color of the shape that was in the foreground.

Let's try another pathfinder option

!!! tip "Step 12"

	a. Clear the canvas

	b. Make a large rectangular shape with a fill color

	c. Make a few smaller shapes, such as circles and triangles and place them in front of the square


!!! tip "Step 13"

	a. Select all the smaller shapes by holding shift while you click each of them
	b. Right click and choose "Group"

!!! tip "Step 14"

	a. Select all the smaller shapes by holding shift while you click each of them

	b. Right click and choose "Group"

![intersect](assets/intersect.gif#large)
<br>

This option will "cut out" any of the shapes in the foreground from the background shape

## Wrap-Up

The combination of simple shapes tools and the pathfinder menu allows you to make is a powerful way to make complex shapes. Using shapefinder to build complex shapes out of simple shapes will also help you develop your own visual literacy and creativity. Check out the [suggested project](https://elissasoroj.github.io/seeingis/course/shape-proj/), which challenges you to use pathfinder to create a set of icons.
