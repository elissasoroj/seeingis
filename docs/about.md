# About

This resource explores the importance of visual literacy in student learning. Developing visual literacy skill can lead to many benefits for students, especially with regards to their communication skills in a world that is heavily dominated by visual media. Read more in the [Visual Literacy](https://elissasoroj.github.io/seeingis/vlvt/) section. 

Additionally, 65% of students are considered 'visual learners', which suggests that a majority of students would benefit from increased use of visuals in the classroom. In order to take advantage of this learning affinity, instructors will first have to increase their own visual literacy and develop the skills necessary to add visual components to their own teaching. 

This resource seeks to help instructors improve their own visual literacy by providing a short, accessible crash course on creating vector graphics using [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html). Although the tutorial is specific to Illustrator, the underlying concepts can easily be applied to other vector graphics programs, such as [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org).
