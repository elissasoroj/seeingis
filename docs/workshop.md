# Self-Guided Workshop

??? tip "LTF Observation"

    If you are an LTF here to observe the workshop "Art of the Science Graphic", you can access the feedback form <a href="https://forms.gle/teADLeQd69rZv3N5A" target="_blank">here</a>.

This section will walk you through the process of identifying a visual you would like to create for a teaching-related application.


## Overview

**This part of the resouce is under development**, however the basic steps that will be covered are as follows:

1. Determine the **main purpose** of the graphic and the **intended audience**. Try to write a single sentence that captures the reason you are making a graphic. Take a moment to consider whether a graphic will enhance your audience's understanding of what you intend to communicate, or whether it can be easily achieved via written text (or verbal explanation).
2. Identify all of the discrete goals that you would like your graphic to achieve
	* Are you trying to explain a **concept**, **contextualize data**, or describe how something **looks** or **works**? 
	* Sometimes you are trying to achieve many things at once in a single graphic. Identify each of the goals you are trying to achieve. Keep these goals simple - split complex goals into smaller ones (see slide 5). 
3. Brainstorm what each of these elements of the figure might be - this is just an initial idea. Remember that at least **one element** of your graphic should correspond to exactly one of each goal you identified in step 2. (see slide 6)
4. Sketch out the composition using **general shapes** for each element. You are determining relative **placement** and **size**. Indicate areas of any important pieces of text, including legends (see slide 7). Consider the following:
	1. What **aspect ratio** (length:width) is your figure going to be? Is your figure going to be portrait or landscape? 
	2. What is the **maximum width and height** your graphic will be viewed at (e.g. a giant screen during a talk vs. no larger than a piece of paper)
	3. Does the eye naturally flow through the figure in the order you would like the audience to 'read' in? 
	4. Did you leave some **white space** between elements to give them separation and reduce overwhelming clutter?
5. Refine your sketch (slide 9)
	1. Here, you are adding in more detail about each element, which means you will start making decisions about what they will look like. For example: will you use pictures, silhouettes, or outlines to represent elements like cells, organisms, or other objects? 
	2. You may find as you nail down the specifics of your elements, you need to make adjustments to the composition. Luckily, your composition is just a bunch of simple shapes, so this should not be overly taxing. Keep working on that sketch until it looks right - this will save you a ton of time later.
		* If you don't like sketching by hand on paper, you can make shapes in a vector image editor, like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape and move them around that way. 
6. Reflect on your working design, and (optional) solicit feedback (slide 10)
	1. Return to the **main purpose** and **goals** you identified in steps 1-2. Does your current sketch reflect these goals? Are there parts you've included that can be removed? 
	2. Once you have a sketch that can communicate the final look/intent, it is a good idea to solicit feedback from experts and/or collaborators. 
	3. Making changes at this early stage will be easier than making them later.
7. Create and assemble the elements. This process will look very different depending on the subject and the knowledge of the author. However, one approach is as follows:
	1. Identify the most important element of the figure and design that first. You will be making decisions about style (i.e. abstraction vs. realism) and color, which will inform the rest of the figure design. Workshop this element until you are satisfied with it - if you are unsure, try asking colleagues about it. When evaluating this element or soliciting feedback, you should easily be able to articulate the purpose it serves, because you identified it in **step 2**. 
	2. Place the finished element into your refined sketch
		* Make any necessary adjustments to the composition
	3. Continue developing the elements of the graphic, using the first element as a guide for style and colors.
