# Self-Guided Workshop

*This section will walk you through the process of identifying a visual you would like to create for a teaching-related application*

**This part of the resouce is under development**, however the basic steps that will be covered are as follows: 

1. Identify the application you would like to use this visual for; guided questions will help you evaluate whether this approach makes sense
3. Narrow down your focus to a specific concept that you would like to convey
4. Sketch an initial idea - this will include a number of exerices to help generate creativity/confidence and these are approaches that teachers can implement in their own classroom if they are interested in implementing ideas of visual literacy in their own courses
5. Reflect on whether your sketch is addressing your concept using guiding questions
6. Make any adjustments to the sketch, and repeat the reflection if desired
7. Gather references
8. Make the resource
9. Evaluate your visual using guided questions
10. Make notes of what you hope to convey with this visual - these will help when you actually use it! Also make notes of any challenges you had or any changes you might make to your process or approach in the future. Consider sharing some of these reflections in the feedback section on the resource website!
