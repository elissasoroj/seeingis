You can download a copy here (password protected - only workshop participants can access).</p> <ol> <li>Determine the main purpose of the graphic and the intended audience. Try to write a single sentence that captures the reason you are making a graphic. Take a moment to consider whether a graphic will enhance your audience's understanding of what you intend to communicate, or whether it can be easily achieved via written text (or verbal explanation).</li> <li>Identify all of the discrete goals that you would like your graphic to achieve<ul> <li>Are you trying to explain a concept, contextualize data, or describe how something looks or works? </li> <li>Sometimes you are trying to achieve many things at once in a single graphic. Identify each of the goals you are trying to achieve. Keep these goals simple - split complex goals into smaller ones (see slide 5). </li> </ul> </li> <li>Brainstorm what each of these elements of the figure might be - this is just an initial idea. Remember that at least one element of your graphic should correspond to exactly one of each goal you identified in step 2. (see slide 6)</li> <li>Sketch out the composition using general shapes for each element. You are determining relative placement and size. Indicate areas of any important pieces of text, including legends (see slide 7). Consider the following:<ol> <li>What aspect ratio (length:width) is your figure going to be? Is your figure going to be portrait or landscape? </li> <li>What is the maximum width and height your graphic will be viewed at (e.g. a giant screen during a talk vs. no larger than a piece of paper)</li> <li>Does the eye naturally flow through the figure in the order you would like the audience to 'read' in? </li> <li>Did you leave some white space between elements to give them separation and reduce overwhelming clutter?</li> </ol> </li> <li>Refine your sketch (slide 9)<ol> <li>Here, you are adding in more detail about each element, which means you will start making decisions about what they will look like. For example: will you use pictures, silhouettes, or outlines to represent elements like cells, organisms, or other objects? </li> <li>You may find as you nail down the specifics of your elements, you need to make adjustments to the composition. Luckily, your composition is just a bunch of simple shapes, so this should not be overly taxing. Keep working on that sketch until it looks right - this will save you a ton of time later.<ul> <li>If you don't like sketching by hand on paper, you can make shapes in a vector image editor, like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape and move them around that way. </li> </ul> </li> </ol> </li> <li>Reflect on your working design, and (optional) solicit feedback (slide 10)<ol> <li>Return to the main purpose and goals you identified in steps 1-2. Does your current sketch reflect these goals? Are there parts you've included that can be removed? </li> <li>Once you have a sketch that can communicate the final look/intent, it is a good idea to solicit feedback from experts and/or collaborators. </li> <li>Making changes at this early stage will be easier than making them later.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Create and assemble the elements. This process will look very different depending on the subject and the knowledge of the author. However, one approach is as follows:<ol> <li>Identify the most important element of the figure and design that first. You will be making decisions about style (i.e. abstraction vs. realism) and color, which will inform the rest of the figure design. Workshop this element until you are satisfied with it - if you are unsure, try asking colleagues about it. When evaluating this element or soliciting feedback, you should easily be able to articulate the purpose it serves, because you identified it in step 2. </li> <li>Place the finished element into your refined sketch<ul> <li>Make any necessary adjustments to the composition</li> </ul> </li> <li>Continue developing the elements of the graphic, using the first element as a guide for style and colors. </li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>This site is actively being updated to provide additional resources to help with each of these steps, especially Step 7.

This is changing, but generally you should always plan to save your image out as a raster file. To figure out how big you should make your canvas, there are two approaches depending on the use of the image. </p> <ol> <li> <p>Digital: if you are planning on using the image exclusively on screens (i.e. emails, presentations, twitter, etc...) then think about the screen size in pixels. Although it's tempting to just think about your own screen size, you should think about all the potential screens that may have your image on it, and cater to the largest one. Here are some common options: </p> <ul> <li>a macbook pro laptop with Retina display has dimensions 3456\u00d72234 px</li> <li>an HDTV (1080p): 1920\u00d71080 px </li> <li>4K: 3840x2160  px</li> </ul> <p>Now, consider how big you want your image to be on the screen. A little icon may only ever take up a tiny fraction of the screen, while a large image should have the longer dimension scaled to the size of the screen. </p> <p>For example, say I want to design an image that has a W:L ratio of 8:2 for a 4K screen. I would need to make sure the width of my canvas was at least 2000px, making my height 500px. Now consider I want to make an image with W:L of 2:8 - my height should be about 3800px and that makes the width 950px. </p> </li> <li> <p>Printed: if you are planning to print your image, then we will use a piece of paper to help us figure out the dimensions. Think about how much of a piece of regular 8.5\"x11\" printer paper (approximately A4) you want your image to take up, and determine the dimension in inches. </p> <ul> <li>For an image that takes up a quarter of a piece of paper, I want 4.25\"x5.5\"</li> <li>For an image that takes up half the length, but the full width of a page, I want 8.5\"x5.5\"</li> <li>Techncially you can determine your image size in whatever units you want. If you think more naturally with cm or mm you can determine your image size in those units instead</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Now, if you are making a digital image, set the units to pixels and simply enter the pixel dimensions</p> <p>If you are making a printed image, then choose your units from the drop-down menu on the right (e.g. inches, cm, mm, etc...)</p> <p>In order to get a high-resolution print, your image should have 300 pixels per inch, which is also known as 300dpi (dots-per-inch) or 300ppi (points-per-inch). This is a useful standard to know. You can multiply your dimentions in inches by 300 manually to determine the pixel dimension, but Illustrator makes it easier than that. </p> <p>Under Raster Effects you can choose the ppi, and 300 ppi is one of the standard choices.

The way that images are produced may be different than how they are reproduced, which can introduce confusion when dealing with files. For example, a vector image may be created within a vector software on a computer (where it will be displayed on a screen). The vector image may then be displayed on a webpage in its original vector form. However, it may also be converted into a raster image, which is a necessary step before it can be printed or uploaded to certain websites, such as social media. </p> <p>This page covers the basics of dealing with vector and raster images, and some considerations to keep in mind when creating your own images. </p>"},{"location":"course/vector-intro/#pixels-resolution-and-file-sizes","title":"Pixels, Resolution, and File Sizes","text":"<p>The term pixel does not actually have a specific definition - it can refer abstractly to the smallest unit an image, but it turns out this isn't a very practical definition because that unit is highly context-dependent.</p>"},{"location":"course/vector-intro/#resolution","title":"Resolution","text":"<p>Resolution is another term that lacks specificity. Resolution is often defined in terms of pixels, which is where the ambiguity arises. From a practical standpoint, resolution refers to the dimensions in pixel units of an image. </p> <p>Despite the ambiguity, this is the most useful way to think about the \"size\" of an image. The pixel dimensions tell you everything you need to know about reproducing that image, which will change depending on the context (i.e. if you are reproducing the image on a screen, or in print). The thing that people find most confusing is that pixels don't have set corresponding physical units - so it is hard at first to conceptualize what it means to define an image in this way. I have found it useful to think about images in terms of how much information, or literal data, it has. For raster images, the more data it has (i.e. the higher the resolution), the bigger it can be (successfully) reproduced on screens and in print. As we will get to at the end of this page, the power of vector graphics is that, unlike raster images, they are not defined using pixels. This means that the amount of information they contain does not constrain what size they can be displayed at. In other words, vector images do not have a resolution. </p>"},{"location":"course/vector-intro/#screens","title":"Screens","text":"<p>Screens are made up of physical, hardware pixels - the tiniest unit of light that makes up the screen. You can think of your screen as a grid of tiny light bulbs, each of which can be controlled individually. The brightness of each pixel can be adjusted to form a black and white picture - but color is slightly more complicated. Each \"pixel\" needs to be subdivided into 3 sub-pixels of a different color: red, green, and blue. Red, green, and blue light at their brightest combine to form white light. The brightness of each sub-pixel can be adjusted to form other colors, and pixels that are off will appear black. </p> <p>We can use this idea to start thinking about file sizes and resolution. In the same way you screen can display an image by adjusting the amount of red, green, and blue light emitted by each pixel, an image file can be stored as a grid of data (pixels) that specifies a color for each cell. There are different ways that color value can be stored. Color can be encoded in a way that corresponds directly to screen hardware, in other words, by a value corresponding to the amount of red, green, and blue that should be mixed to produce the color. That means for each pixel in your image, you need to store 3 values, each of which can take on a value of 0-255. For example: * (255, 255, 255) is highest values for all three colors, which produces white * (0, 0, 0) is no color in color in RGB, or black * (255, 0, 0) is pure red</p> <p>...and so on. If you have spent time designing websites or generating images using code (e.g. R, Python) then you have likely encountered HEX codes. HEX, or hexadecimal numbers, are 6-digit codes that correspond to specific RGB values. They reduce the number of bits needed to encode color information and are easier to deal with than RGB values. </p> <p>However, there are other ways of encoding color information. CMYK specifies four values (corresponding to cyan, magenta, yellow, and black), which is also how colored inks are mixed for printing, as discussed below. </p> <p>Changing the color profile of a file from RGB to CMYK will change the file size. This may seem counter-intuitive, but this is because more information needs to be stored when a color is specified in CMYK than if it is specified in RGB. </p>"},{"location":"course/vector-intro/#print","title":"Print","text":"<p>Printed images are also made up of pixels, but they are printed pixels - often referred to as dots. Printers generally use a mixture of Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black (CMYK) inks to achieve color. The printing area is divided into a grid of dots, and a dot of each ink color needs to be placed at each position. The radius of the dot is adjusted by the printer in order to achieve the illusion of those colors mixing. </p>"},{"location":"workshop/coming-soon/","title":"Workshop","text":"<p> Coming Soon!</p>"},{"location":"workshop/resources/","title":"Outside Resources","text":""},{"location":"workshop/resources/#examples","title":"Examples","text":"<p>One of the best ways to get started with designing your own graphic is to look at some examples and get inspired. It can be helpful to keep a folder full of graphics that you like, which you can always visit when you're feeling stuck (try to make sure you maintain a link to the original artist!). The ever-misattributed quote \"good artists borrow; great artists steal\" is applicable here - you can steal compositions, color schemes, and concepts from existing work that is successful. Of course, what you can't steal is specific elements from other people's work, and you should try to develop your own style rather than copying someone else's - this will give your work its own voice. </p>"},{"location":"workshop/resources/#amazing-science-graphics-artists","title":"Amazing Science Graphics &amp; Artists","text":"<ul> <li>Tabletop Whale (Eleanor Lutz): hand-drawn animations</li> <li>Lucy Reading-Ikkanda and her conference talk: hand drawn animations and graphics</li> <li>Matteo Farinella and his project Cartoon Science: comics</li> <li>Science Finds Art: a curated set of portfolios by working scientific illustrators </li> <li>Visual Capitalist: good examples of data visualization</li> <li>ArtSci Studios: mostly large infographics</li> </ul>"},{"location":"workshop/resources/#magazines","title":"Magazines","text":"<ul> <li>Quanta Magazine</li> <li>Scientific American</li> </ul>"},{"location":"workshop/resources/#learn-more","title":"Learn More","text":"<p>Learning to communicate visually should be (at least in my opinion) a full course that is taught to every graduate student.
